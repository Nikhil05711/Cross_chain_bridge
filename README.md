Cross-chain bridges are software applications that enable transactions to occur between various blockchains. If someone wants to transfer cryptocurrency, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or other digital assets between blockchain networks, cross-chain bridges are an essential part of the process. While most digital assets are tied to a specific blockchain, cross-chain bridges enable inter-network transactions powering a much broader digital ecosystem. Using cross-chain bridges, cryptocurrency owners can unlock the value held in their crypto portfolios for a wider range of real-life uses.

Cross-chain bridges enable many innovative processes, but security concerns surround them, as these apps have experienced hacking losses.
